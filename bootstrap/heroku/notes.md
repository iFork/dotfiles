Heroku Usage
=============

`heroku help <command>` 

# Basic steps

```bash
heroku login
heroku create
	# adds (additional) git remote named heroku to your git repo
# add Procfile
git push heroku master
	# push to the remote named heroku
heroku ps:scale web=1
	# Ensuring that at least one instance of the app is running:
heroku open
	# visit app url
heroku logs --tail
	# view logs
```

# Pushing to heroku

**NB** If you are deploying from a git repository where your code is not on the master branch you will need to run `git push heroku HEAD:master`. If you have already done a push to heroku, you may need to run `git push heroku HEAD:master --force`.

> `git push <remote> <refspec>` where resfspec is of format 
> `<source object/branch>:<destination ref/branch>`
> From git help push:
> The <src> is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such as master~4 or HEAD (see gitrevisions(7)).
> The <dst> tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must be named.
> If git push [<repository>] without any <refspec> argument is set to update some ref at the destination with <src> with remote.<repository>.push configuration variable, :<dst> part can be omitted â€” such a push will update a ref that <src> normally updates without any <refspec> on the command line. Otherwise, missing :<dst> means to update the same ref as the <src>.

## Using git subtree

### Pushing subtree as its own project

[How can I deploy/push only a subdirectory of my git repo to Heroku? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7539382/how-can-i-deploy-push-only-a-subdirectory-of-my-git-repo-to-heroku)

Pushing part of a git repo into another git repo as a root dir.

```
git subtree push --prefix <subtree's dir> <remote> (<remote branch> | <refspec>)
# e.g. git subtree push --prefix output heroku master
```

Or first creating subtree using `split` command and putting it in its own branch:
my example

```
$ git subtree split --prefix part3/practice --annotate='(split) ' -b practice-notes-deploy
Created branch 'practice-notes-deploy'

$ git push heroku practice-notes-deploy:master
```

or with rejoin

```
$ git subtree split -P part3/practice -b practice-notes-deploy2 --rejoin --annotate='(split) '
Merge made by the 'ours' strategy.
See "git help gc" for manual housekeeping.
warning: The last gc run reported the following. Please correct the root cause
and remove .git/gc.log.

Created branch 'practice-notes-deploy2'
```

But to achieve effect of <refspect> of the form <source branch>:<destination branch> use instead:

> if you want to push a specific tag or branch in combination with subtree? Like 'git push heroku yourbranch:master'?
> In this case you cannot use the subtree push shortcut and have to chain commands youself. For example: 

```bash
git push heroku `git subtree split --prefix web yourbranch`:master
```

> https://stackoverflow.com/a/34871620/2916845
> If you want to push a subtree of a branch to become your master, you can use something like:

```bash
git push --force heroku `git subtree split --prefix web HEAD`:master
```

> I successfully pushed the output folder that was only present on my develop branch to the heroku master branch without the need of specifying develop:master, so apparently it pushes to the target branch you specify *from your currently checked out branch*.

### Example from git-subtree manual

[manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt), git help subtree

```bash
git subtree split --prefix=gitweb --annotate='(split) ' \
  	0a8f4f0^.. --onto=1130ef3 --rejoin \
  	--branch gitweb-latest
gitk gitweb-latest
git push git@github.com:whatever/gitweb.git gitweb-latest:master
```

If gitweb had originally been merged using 'git subtree add' (or a previous split had already been done with --rejoin specified) then you can do all your splits without having to remember any weird commit ids:

```bash
git subtree split --prefix=gitweb --annotate='(split) ' --rejoin \
	--branch gitweb-latest2
```

And you can merge changes back in from the upstream project just as easily:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=gitweb \
	git@github.com:whatever/gitweb.git master
```

### Updating upstream subtree and merging downstream

```
# on <source branch>
# branch from which subtree is to be split into a new 'deploy' branch

git subtree split -P part3/practice -b deploy --annotate="(split) "

	# commit chnages to the prefix directory on <source branch>
```


merge upstream changes when upstream is a 'super-repo'
(not a dedicated repo of our subtree)
split in-place 'super-repo' with the same 'annotation'
to create source matching our target subtree


```
# when in a 'super-repo' / on a 'super-branch'
git subtree merge -P <dir prefix> \
	`git subtree split -P <same dir prefix> <source branch/commit> \
	--annotate="(split) "`
```

```
git checkout <branch of subtree created by subtree split command>
# when on a (dedicated) branch of the subtree
git merge \
	`git subtree split -P part3/practice --annotate='(split) ' practice `

```

In this case no prior --rejoin (in prior split command) was required.
When not creating split in-line but merging just a source branch, whole source branch is merged, not just the files from prefix dir.
This latter (merging whole source branch) happens only when --rejoin was specified in the initial split (and therfore source branch remembers about a split). Otherwise merge is refused due to 'unrelated histories' and subtree merge command rejects 'allow-unrelated-histories' flag.

# Build and Deploy Script (move out?)

- [] move out to npm script notes file 
 - [] will it belong to 'bootstrap notes' or into a joplin/snippets/npm?


```
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    
	"build:ui": "echo removing build && rm -rf build && echo cd to frontend && cd ../../part2/practice && pwd && echo build frontend && npm run build --prod && echo copy build back && cp -r build $OLDPWD",
    
	"deploy": "git checkout practice-notes-deploy && echo cd to top level of the working tree for the git subtree merge && cd ../../ && git merge `git subtree split -P part3/practice practice --annotate='(split) '` && git push heroku practice-notes-deploy:master",
    
	"deploy:full": "git checkout practice && npm run build:ui && echo commit build to backend && git add build && echo commit if there is a change && (git diff-index --quiet --cached HEAD || git commit -m UI-build) && echo deploying...  && npm run deploy",

	"logs:prod": "heroku logs -t"
```



Note that this code uses `&` instead of `&&`. The former means to run the script in the background, meaning that they execute in parallel and their output is shuffled together. The latter would mean to execute the _next_ command only if the _current_ command exits without an error code.



# git branches instead of subfolders (move out?)

- [] move out to git notes ?
 - [] will it belong to bootstrap notes or joplin/git/Some (stared) usage note ?

You could also use git branches instead of subfolders. If you have git 1.7.2 or newer, you can simply do git checkout --orphan android to create a branch that is disconnected from your master branch (assumed here to be the web folder). Once you have checked out the orphan branch, run git rm -rf . to remove existing files before copying in your android-specific files to the now empty root directory.

# Procfile

Use a Procfile, a text file in the root directory of your application, to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.

## Example for node application:

```
web: node index.js
```

This declares a single process type, `web`, and the command needed to run it. The name web is important here. It declares that this process type will be attached to the HTTP routing stack.

# Processes and dynos

```bash
heroku ps
	# check how many dynos are running 
heroku ps:scale web=1
	# Ensuring that at least one instance of the app is running:

heroku ps:restart web.1
	# restart process web.1
```

> For abuse prevention, scaling a non-free application to more than one dyno requires account verification.


# [Managing config vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#managing-config-vars)

Whenever you set or remove a config var using any method, your app is restarted and a new [release](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases) is created.

Config var values are persistentâ€“they remain in place across deploys and app restarts. Unless you need to change a value, you only need to set it once.

## Using the Heroku CLI

The `heroku config` commands of the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) makes it easy to manage your appâ€™s config vars.

View current config var values


```term
heroku config 
GITHUB_USERNAME: joesmith 
OTHER_VAR: production

heroku config:get GITHUB_USERNAME
joesmith
```

Set a config var

```term
heroku config:set GITHUB_USERNAME=joesmith
Adding config vars and restarting myapp... done, v12
GITHUB_USERNAME: joesmith
```

Remove a config var


```
heroku config:unset GITHUB_USERNAME 
Unsetting GITHUB_USERNAME and restarting myapp... done, v13
```
