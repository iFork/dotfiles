! Usage: run `$ xmodmap ~/.xmodmap`
! make a backup configuration, like so:
! xmodmap -pke > ~/originalkeymap.xmod
! CLI example:
! xmodmap -e "keysym Caps_Lock = NoSymbol"

! ~/.profile runs early in the login sequence. If your desktop environment configures a keyboard layout, it can overwrite the settings you've just loaded.
! Put your settings in a file called ~/.Xmodmap:
! Under the default Gnome environment in Ubuntu 10.04, the next time you log in, you will be prompted as to whether to load ~/.Xmodmap. Load it, and tick “don't ask me again”. Then your .Xmodmap will be applied after the default settings.

! Caps is neither caps nor ctrl (seems to not work)
!
! remove Lock = Caps_Lock
! keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
! add Lock = Caps_Lock  

! change caps to control, remove caps

! clear Lock
! keycode 0x7e = Control_R
! add Control = Control_R

! Maybe you have to change the keycode 0x7e. You can find the keycodes with `xev`. I Furthermore, this only works if you don't have a right control key. I hope somebody has a

! If you get stuck and find yourself without a control key use `xev` to find the keycode of your control and caps lock keys. Then use the following to restore the default config.

! remove Lock = Caps_Lock
! remove Control = Control_L
! keycode <keycodeofcontrol> = Control_L
! keycode <keycodeofcapslock> = Caps_Lock
! add Lock = Caps_Lock
! add Control = Control_L
